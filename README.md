# Doctor Appointment System Using Logisim

## This was a final semester project of Digital Circuits created by our group.

The Program will not work properly unless all of the instructions are followed, so please follow through all of the steps sequentially:
1) Open Logisim
2) Go to Open and select the 7seg.circ

As you can see the 7seg.circ is the main program, the rest of the circuits are imported as libraries into this

3) Then go to simulate and press 'tick enabled'
4) Go to Tick Frequency and select frequency equal to 1kHZ (Note a different freq might lead to very short or long waiting times for display)

YOU ARE GOOD TO GO NOW!

Some things to Note:
1) Each Queue - Normal and Emergency - can only hold three values at a single time, so if it gets full you will have to pop it to add another one otherwise it will not take in anything
2) The Number counter is only 0 - 15, therefore, as soon as it gets to 15 it'll reset back to 0, but this will not cause any error and the program can continue normally
